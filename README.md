# A Hybrid Sudoku Hangman Game
A unique twist on two classic gamesâ€”Sudoku and Hangmanâ€”combined into a single interactive Python-based experience. Solve Sudoku puzzles while avoiding wrong guesses in a Hangman challenge. Test your logic and vocabulary as you solve Sudoku puzzles with an added twist: wrong inputs could cost you in a Hangman-style penalty!

## Features

- Classic **Sudoku** board generation and solving
- Integrated **Hangman** mechanics for incorrect number placements
- Turn-based logic to keep both games synchronized
- Visual feedback for Hangman progress
- Command-line interface using Python

##  How It Works

- Start with a Sudoku puzzle.
- Input numbers into the board.
- If your input is incorrect (either logically or placement-wise), a part of the Hangman figure is drawn.
- The game ends either when:
  - You solve the Sudoku puzzle (ðŸŽ‰), or
  - You complete the Hangman figure (ðŸ’€).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
